The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-T2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 755 V1.3.1 Frame structure
channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital
terrestrial television broadcasting system (DVB-T2):

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302700_302799/302755/01.03.01_60/en_302755v010301p.pdf

The baseband framing, baseband scrambling, LDPC (low density
parity check) and BCH (Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem) blocks
are reused from gr-dvbs2 (https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-dvbs2)
which are originally from G4GUO's DATV-Express Digital Amateur
Television project. The bit interleaver, DVB-T2 modulator,
cell and time interleaver, frame mapper, frequency interleaver,
pilot generator, P1 symbol insertion, Tone Reservation PAPR and
MISO processing blocks are all new.

The baseline implementation has been verified against the BBC
test streams available here:

ftp://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/t2refs/

Currently, the implementation is bit perfect with the VV001-CR35,
VV003-CR23, VV004-8KFFT, VV005-8KFFT, VV007-16KFFT, VV008-16FFT,
VV009-4KFFT, VV010-2KFFT, VV011-1KFFT, VV012-64QAM45, VV014-64QAM34,
VV015-8KFFT, VV016-256QAM34, VV018-MISO, VV019-NOROT and VV034-DTG016
profiles. The VV003-CR23 profile is the current HD broadcast mode
(32K/256QAM at 40.2 Mbps or Ofcom Mode 7) in the UK.

Test streams for the VV003-CR23, VV009-4KFFT and VV018-MISO profiles
with an 8 MHz channel are available.

A stand-alone Python script (dvbt2-blade.py) is included for the
bladeRF SDR and matches the VV009-4KFFT profile and test stream.

IMPORTANT: The tone reservation PAPR block is very floating point
intensive and only runs in real-time on the VV016-256QAM34 profile.

Version 1.1.1 features not implemented:

1) Generic Encapsulated Stream (GSE)
2) Generic Continuous Stream (GCS)
3) Generic Fixed-length Packetized Stream (GFPS)
4) Input Stream Synchronization
5) Null Packet Deletion
6) In-band signalling Type A
7) Active Constellation Extension (ACE) PAPR
8) Time interleaver type 2
9) Common PLP
10) Multiple PLP
11) Type 2 PLP
12) Auxiliary streams
13) FEF
14) Sub-slices

Version 1.3.1 features not implemented:

1) L1-ACE
2) Bias balancing cells

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

IMPORTANT: Because some of the blocks have to process entire
T2 frames, the shared memory requirement will be greater than
the Linux default. The size of shared memory can be increased
with the following shell commands:

    sudo -i
    echo $(( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 )) > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
    logout

Contributions are welcome!
